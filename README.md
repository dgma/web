## Before you start

1. This project uses GitHub Packages as a private NPM registry. You need to authenticate to GitHub Packages before you can install dependencies. To do that you need to create `.npmrc` file in the root of the project and add the following line to it:

```bash
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<your-token>
@safenook:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Replace `<your-token>` with your personal access token. You can read about how to create this token [here](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages).

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the running website.
